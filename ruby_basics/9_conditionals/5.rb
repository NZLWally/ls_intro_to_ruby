# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# will print "My favourite number is 7" because an integer has a truthy value. Anything except false and nil are truthy.
